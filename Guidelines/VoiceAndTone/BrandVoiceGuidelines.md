# Boot Scootin' Bulls Brand Voice Guidelines

## Introduction
Welcome to the Boot Scootin' Bulls Brand Voice Guidelines! Our voice embodies the spirit of USF and the excitement of line dancing. It’s designed to be engaging, welcoming, and fun, ensuring that everyone—from rookies to seasoned dancers—feels at home.

## Our Brand Voice

### 1. Energetic
We’re all about the energy and enthusiasm of dancing. Use dynamic and lively language that motivates our members to get up and dance!

>**Examples:**
- "Let’s hit the dance floor with energy that even a bull can’t beat!"
- "Get ready to kick up your heels and make sparks fly!"

### 2. Inclusive
Our club is a community where everyone is welcome, and everyone belongs. Our language should always be inclusive, respectful, and supportive.

>**Examples:**
- "Join our circle—everyone’s invited, from beginners to pros!"
- "At Boot Scootin' Bulls, there’s a spot on the dance floor for everyone."

### 3. Playful
We take our fun seriously! Don’t be afraid to inject humor and playfulness into our communications.

>**Examples:**
- "Grab your boots, and let’s scoot! Don’t worry if you stumble—a little goof is part of the fun."
- "Dance like nobody’s watching (even though we all are, and we’re totally impressed!)"

## Tone Adjustments

### Formal Events
While maintaining our friendly demeanor, elevate the language slightly for formal communications or official events.

>**Example:**
- "We cordially invite you to join us at the annual USF Line Dancing Gala. Come celebrate a year of great steps and good company."

### Informal Settings
In casual interactions, especially on social media, feel free to be more laid-back and conversational.

>**Example:**
- "Hey Bulls! Ready to dance the night away? See y’all tonight at the usual spot. Bring your friends and let’s make some memories!"

## Usage
Always remember that our voice represents the Boot Scootin' Bulls wherever it appears—from social media posts to official newsletters. Keep it consistent, but also adaptable to the context and platform.

Thank you for helping us communicate with one voice that’s as spirited as our dances!
