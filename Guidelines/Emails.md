## Overview
### User-Facing Emails
Our user-facing emails (e.g., president@LineDancingUSF.org, secretary@LineDancingUSF.org, marketing@LineDancingUSF.org, instructors@LineDancingUSF.org) are visible and accessible to all club officers. This transparency allows every officer to be aware of ongoing communications and inquiries. However, to streamline responses and maintain accountability, emails received at these addresses are automatically forwarded only to the personal inbox of the officer directly associated with that role. This ensures that the responsible officer is notified immediately of relevant communications, while still maintaining an archive accessible to all officers for oversight and support.

### Individual Officer Accounts
Each officer has an individual email account (e.g., ScooterBull050824@LineDancingUSF.org) that may include their name and other personal identifiers. These accounts are used for internal communications and specific tasks that require personal attention from the officers.

### Back-End Emails
Operational emails such as accounts@LineDancingUSF.org, info@LineDancingUSF.org, and support@LineDancingUSF.org handle specific aspects like social media management, general inquiries, and member support. These emails are designed to segregate different operational functions clearly and effectively, ensuring that queries are directed to the appropriate department.

This email strategy not only protects individual privacy by separating personal officer information from their public-facing roles but also facilitates a seamless transition when roles change hands. By keeping all inquiries visible to all officers but notifying only the responsible parties, we maintain a balance between collaborative awareness and individual accountability.
