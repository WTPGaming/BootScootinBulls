## Campaigns
Campaigns should be strategically planned and prepared well in advance. Ideally, conceptualization should occur four weeks prior to the campaign start date, with finalization and submission of all materials completed three weeks in advance. This schedule allows for a two-week grace period before the campaign launch to facilitate any necessary adjustments, modifications, or enhancements. An automated tool will be implemented to ensure all posts are scheduled for social media and documentation is submitted for approval at least two weeks in advance, ensuring we secure the necessary approvals one week before the campaign goes live.

### Typography
By adhering to these strict guidelines, your club's communications and promotional materials will present a unified, professional, and easily readable appearance, reinforcing the club's brand identity consistently across all media.

#### Font Family Usage
- **OpenSans**
  - Usage: Main text for documents, web content, and promotional materials.
  - Weight: Regular (400) for body text; Bold (700) for headings.
  - Size: Body text at 1em (typically 16px); Headings ranging from 1.25em (20px) to 2em (32px), depending on the level of heading.
- **Nadaka Western**
  - Usage: Stylistic elements such as pull quotes or special announcements.
  - Weight: Regular (400).
  - Size: Similar to body text or slightly larger to maintain legibility, approximately 1.1em (17.6px).
- **OCR A Extended**
  - Usage: Information requiring high readability, such as instructional leaflets or technical descriptions.
  - Weight: Regular (400).
  - Size: Use a larger size for clear readability, around 1.2em (19.2px).

#### General Typography Rules
- **Line Spacing (Leading)**
  - Set line spacing at 1.5 times the font size for body text to improve readability. For example, if the body text is 16px, line spacing should be 24px.
- **Letter Spacing (Tracking)**
  - Normal tracking for body text and slightly increased for uppercase or small text to enhance legibility.
- **Text Alignment**
  - Align body text to the left; centered text can be used for headings or titles if design permits.
- **Margins and Padding**
  - Ensure that text does not touch the edges of the design elements; maintain a minimum padding of 0.5em around text blocks.

#### Special Instructions
- Capitalize headings to draw attention and differentiate from body text.
- Use italics sparingly, primarily for emphasis or for quotes.
- Avoid underlining for emphasis; use bold or color changes instead.
- **Color and Contrast**
  - Ensure that text color contrasts sufficiently with the background for visibility. Prefer dark text on light backgrounds or light text on dark backgrounds.

#### Application in Media
- **Digital Media**
  - For digital displays such as screens or online platforms, ensure that the font size adjusts to different resolutions and screen sizes using relative units like percentages or em.
- **Print Media**
  - For printed materials, adhere to the font size guidelines but consider the impact of different paper sizes and print quality on readability.

## Brand Voice

### Energetic
We’re all about the energy and enthusiasm of dancing. Use dynamic and lively language that motivates our members to get up and dance!

- "Let’s hit the dance floor with energy that even a bull can’t beat!"
- "Get ready to kick up your heels and make sparks fly!"

### Inclusive
Our club is a community where everyone is welcome, and everyone belongs. Our language should always be inclusive, respectful, and supportive.

>**Examples:**
- "Join our circle—everyone’s invited, from beginners to pros!"

### Playful
We take our fun seriously! Don’t be afraid to inject humor and playfulness into our communications.

>**Examples:**
- "Grab your boots, and let’s scoot! Don’t worry if you stumble—a little goof is part of the fun."
- "Dance like nobody’s watching (even though we all are, and we’re totally impressed!)"

## Tone Adjustments

### Formal Events
While maintaining our friendly demeanor, elevate the language slightly for formal communications or official events.

>**Example:**
- "We cordially invite you to join us at the annual USF Line Dancing Gala. Come celebrate a year of great steps and good company."

### Informal Settings
In casual interactions, especially on social media, feel free to be more laid-back and conversational.

>**Example:**
- "Hey Bulls! Ready to dance the night away? See y’all tonight at the usual spot. Bring your friends and let’s make some memories!"

## Usage
Always remember that our voice represents the Boot Scootin' Bulls wherever it appears—from social media posts to official newsletters. Keep it consistent, but also adaptable to the context and platform.

Thank you for helping us communicate with one voice that’s as spirited as our dances!
